# Arduino Reference Projects for Adafruit Feather RP2040

Various reference programs written for the [Adafruit Feather RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884). Projects using ethernet have been written for and tested with the [Silicognition PoE FeatherWing](https://silicognition.com/Products/poe-featherwing/), but should also work with the [Adafruit Ethernet FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3201).

## Catalog

1. [Hello World](/hello_world) - writes messages to the serial port
1. [Blink](/blink) - uses the onboard NANOPIXEL to blink
1. [Momentary Switch](/momentary_switch) - uses NO momentary switch to trigger an input pin
1. [PWM](/pwm) - uses analog pin to fade LED in and out via pulse-width modulation (PWM)
1. [Ethernet](/ethernet) - use the W5500 to set a static IP
1. [MQTT](/mqtt) - use the W5500 to connect to an MQTT broker and pub/sub to topics
