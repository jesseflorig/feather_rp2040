# Arduino Reference Projects for Adafruit Feather RP2040

Various reference programs written for the [Adafruit Feather RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884). Projects using ethernet have been written for and tested with the [Silicognition PoE FeatherWing](https://silicognition.com/Products/poe-featherwing/), but should also work with the [Adafruit Ethernet FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3201).
